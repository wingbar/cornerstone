# Set Up

I made my store and then downloaded Stencil CLI. To start I got acquainted with the documentation. I spent a while reading and learning before hopping into the tasks.

# Special Item Task

I made a new product and category by going to the BigCommerce website and using their online tool. Then, I added two placeholder images to use in the hover task. 

# Hover Task

To do this task I made it so that the special item would be the only one fetching a second image. Because of this, the only image that changes when you hover over it is the special item. I decided on doing it that way so it would be quicker to load. 

# Buttons Task

This task was really interesting and made me learn a lot about the technology required to develop BigCommerce storefronts. I had to learn a lot about the cart system to do this. An issue I was having was that making a new cart wasn't working with the Add All button. I got past it by reading more and editing my code so it would work. There's still a problem where you can't add an item where you have to custom choose a color. If I had more time to work on this project I would have brought up another window where you were able to choose the colors for the items there. 

# Bonus Task

To do the bonus task I researched more about Handlebars and found out how to get name, phone number, and email address. I spaced the different items out so it would look nicer.

# End Thoughts

I had a really fun time with this part! I really like to learn and getting used to the new languages and setup was interesting.
